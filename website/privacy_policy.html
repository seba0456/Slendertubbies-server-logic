    <p>Welcome to the privacy policy of the game "Slendertubbies," created by seba0456. This document outlines the procedures for collecting, using, and safeguarding player data. By using the game, you consent to the practices described herein.</p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>I want to be transparent about the objectives behind collecting player data. The primary reasons for data collection are as follows:</p>

        <li><strong>Enhancing Player Experience:</strong> I analyze player preferences and behaviors to improve the gameplay experience. Your data helps me tailor the game's elements to align with your preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Adjustments:</strong> Understanding player activity informs me about in-game dynamics. This information is vital for fine-tuning gameplay features and creating an engaging environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you use the "Slendertubbies" game, I collect the following data:</p>
