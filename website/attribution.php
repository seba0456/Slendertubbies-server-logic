    <pp class='slogan'>The development journey of Slendertubbies has been an extensive and rewarding experience. Over the past three years, the game has undergone significant expansion. However, it's crucial to note that Slendertubbies is not the result of a solo effort; I received support from the gaming community and assistance from third-party asset sources such as freesound.org and sketchfab.com. Additionally, this game would not have been possible without the Unreal Engine, Megascans, EOS, and the Unreal Marketplace.
        In this article, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone whose amazing efforts have contributed to the development of Slendertubbies. This project has been a collaborative endeavor, and I want to extend my thanks to the individuals who have played a vital role in its evolution. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge and thank those to whom I am indebted due to licensing obligations.

        <br>Thank you all for being a part of this incredible journey!
